I don't have anything specific to add, you can pretty much "figure out" everything by yourself.
Not everything is totally optimized, so you might want to have a good CPU to run it.

If you still have some questions or things you want to ask me, please message me either on discord (PikaZhou#2283) or send me a mail at daniel.zhou@telecom-paris.fr
