# Maze solver, Yahoou!

I don't have anything specific to add, you can pretty much "figure out" everything by yourself.
Not everything is totally optimized, so you might want to have a good CPU to run it.

If you still have some questions or things you want to ask me, please message me either on discord (@pikazhou with the new discord username update) or send me a mail at daniel.zhou@telecom-paris.fr

PS: The help button will ***not*** work, because it redirects into a private gitlab repository, sorry!
